# netbeans-ems
I created an employee management system using NetBeans, leveraging a hash table data structure. This system accommodates both part-time and full-time employees, offering features such as adding, removing, and searching for employees, updating employee details, and saving/loading files. The interface is graphical, accessible via the implementation in a GUI. To start the project, download the folder and run the "Main_jFrame.java" file. Terminal messages will confirm the system's activation. This project showcases GUI integration, hash table utilization, inheritance, and buffered reading/writing in action.
